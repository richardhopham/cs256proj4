** Project #4
** Description:
** 	Continue from Project 3. Convert the existing Book class into an abstract base class with a
**  public pure virtual method that returns a string for the cover type. Define two concrete derived
**  classes from the Book class, which both implement the 'getCoverType' method from the base class.
**  Modify the Warehouse class by adding a 'createBook_' method that reads in one set of book data from
**  the input data stream and creates an instance of HardcoverBook or PaperbackBook depending on the input
**  data. The program shall be able to process the same data format and produce the same outputs as in
**  Project 3.
